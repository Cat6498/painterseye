# The Painter's Eye

## Introduction

With the recent advances in the fields of Neural Networks and Computer Vision, there has been a rising interest in making AIs generate paintings. However, humans do not perceive or create a painting pixel per pixel. We focus on objects and details, on the things that call out for us from the canvas.
The aim of this research project is to teach an artificial intelligence to paint as a real painter would. Using semantic segmentation to identify the shapes in an image and saliency maps to get the most attracting points, I will try to model an attention mechanism that will drive the painting process of a neural renderer, making it focus more on the most relevant objects.
